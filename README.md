# DevOps

Here you will find a variety of projects that use cutting-edge technologies such as Terraform, Docker, Docker-Compose, Kubernetes, Linux, Bash, TLS, etc. I strive to stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends and practices, while ensuring that I follow best security practices and do not neglect performance.

Each project explores how to improve system efficiency and scalability, while ensuring stability and security. From automated deployments to infrastructure management, to the implementation of monitoring and metric practices.

In this repository, you can find detailed documentation for each project, installation and usage guides, as well as code and script examples.
